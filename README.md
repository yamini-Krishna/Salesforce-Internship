- **Triggers:** Apex scripts that execute before/after database operations.  
- **Process Builder & Flows:** Automation tools for business processes.  
- **Objects & Fields:** Core building blocks that store business data.  
- **Salesforce Security Model:** Controls data access via Profiles, Roles, and Sharing Rules.

âœ… Understanding **Salesforce security models** for role-based access control.  

## Technologies & Tools Learned

### 1. Salesforce Platform  
The Salesforce Platform (Salesforce Lightning) is a cloud-based development environment that enables businesses to build and deploy applications efficiently. Key features include:  
- **Multi-tenancy:** Multiple users share the same infrastructure while keeping their data separate.  
- **Metadata-Driven Architecture:** Customizations are stored as metadata, making updates seamless.  
- **AppExchange:** A marketplace for Salesforce applications and integrations.  

### 2. Apex (Programming Language)  
Apex is Salesforceâ€™s proprietary object-oriented programming language, similar to Java, used for:  
- Automating business logic with custom code.  
- Creating **triggers** that execute before or after DML operations (Insert, Update, Delete).  
- Implementing **batch processing** for handling large data volumes.  
- Writing **custom controllers** for Lightning components.  

### 3. Lightning Web Components (LWC)  
LWC is a modern UI framework based on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, used for building:  
- **Reusable UI components** that enhance user experience.  
- **Client-side applications** that interact with Salesforce data.  
- **Custom dashboards and forms** for streamlined workflows.  

### 4. SOQL & SOSL (Salesforce Query Languages)  
Salesforce provides two powerful query languages for retrieving and manipulating data:  

#### **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)**  
Similar to SQL, used for querying records from Salesforce objects.  
**Example:**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Email FROM Contact WHERE City = 'Hyderabad'
SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language)

Used for searching across multiple objects.
Example:

FIND 'John' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(Name, Email)
## **5. Apex Triggers**  
Apex Triggers are event-driven scripts that execute automatically when records are inserted, updated, or deleted.  

### **Types of Triggers:**  
- **Before Triggers:** Modify records before they are saved to the database.  
- **After Triggers:** Perform operations after records are committed to the database.  

## **6. Process Builder & Flows (Automation Tools)**  
Salesforce provides **low-code automation tools** to streamline business processes:  

- **Process Builder:** Automates workflows based on conditions (e.g., sending emails, updating records).  
- **Flows:** Visual workflows that handle complex logic, such as multi-step approvals and data processing.  

## **7. Salesforce Security Model**  
Security is a critical aspect of Salesforce. It includes:  
- **Profiles & Permission Sets:** Define what users can access.  
- **Role Hierarchies:** Control data visibility.  
- **Sharing Rules:** Extend access based on business needs.  
- **Field-Level Security:** Restricts sensitive data exposure.  


## **Internship Benefits**
