Technologies & Tools Learned

1. Salesforce Platform
The Salesforce Platform (Salesforce Lightning) is a cloud-based development environment that enables businesses to build and deploy applications efficiently. Key features include:

Multi-tenancy: Multiple users share the same infrastructure while keeping their data separate.
Metadata-Driven Architecture: Customizations are stored as metadata, making updates seamless.
AppExchange: A marketplace for Salesforce applications and integrations.
2. Apex (Programming Language)
Apex is Salesforceâ€™s proprietary object-oriented programming language, similar to Java, used for:

Automating business logic with custom code.
Creating triggers that execute before or after DML operations (Insert, Update, Delete).
Implementing batch processing for handling large data volumes.
Writing custom controllers for Lightning components.
3. Lightning Web Components (LWC)
LWC is a modern UI framework based on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, used for building:

Reusable UI components that enhance user experience.
Client-side applications that interact with Salesforce data.
Custom dashboards and forms for streamlined workflows.
4. SOQL & SOSL (Salesforce Query Languages)
Salesforce provides two powerful query languages for retrieving and manipulating data:

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language): Similar to SQL, used for querying records from Salesforce objects.
Example: SELECT Name, Email FROM Contact WHERE City = 'Hyderabad'
SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language): Used for searching across multiple objects.
Example: FIND 'John' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(Name, Email)
5. Apex Triggers
Apex Triggers are event-driven scripts executed automatically when records are inserted, updated, or deleted.

Before Triggers: Modify records before they are saved to the database.
After Triggers: Perform operations after records are committed to the database.
6. Process Builder & Flows (Automation Tools)
Salesforce provides low-code automation tools for handling business logic without extensive coding:

Process Builder: Automates workflows based on conditions (e.g., sending emails, updating records).
Flows: Visual workflows that handle complex logic, such as multi-step approvals and data processing.
7. Salesforce Security Model
Security is a critical aspect of Salesforce. It includes:

Profiles & Permission Sets: Define what users can access.
Role Hierarchies: Control data visibility.
Sharing Rules: Extend access based on business needs.
Field-Level Security: Restricts sensitive data exposure.
